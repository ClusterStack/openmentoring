# openmentoring

I believe we can mentor people to get their job aborad in tech with a simple pratice of discussing the mentee problems, giving advice and make a retrospective on its carreer, to realize how it can impove until it gets to the next problem.

Lucas Oliveira.

## Mentorship Cycle
The mentee will pass in the 3 steps of the mentorship cycle. The first one is to be in a given situation, or having some problem or doubt.
The mentor will analyse and provide some advice and ideas based on his/her experience, thus unblocking the mentee to do more work.
After that, the mentee needs to work, read and reflect on ideas and advice, that will make him/her progress in his/her goals.

## Rules
- be proactive and active, to bring new situations and problems to the mentor
- ask a lot of questions to guide you to find the answer you are looking for
- read everything that was recommended, code everything that is needed, apply advices to test if they work for you
