ps.: This is strictely `open source` project, and it's prohibited to sell products and services into this Repo.

I believe we can mentor people to get their job abroad in tech with a simple pratice of discussing the mentee problems, giving advice and make a retrospective on its carreer, to realize how it can impove until it gets to the next problem.
When I've created [ClusterStack](https://clusterstack.io) the goal is no different. We want to help others to land their jobs abroad and improve their careers, but sometimes you need to reach out someone to understand what you need to improve in other to change and achieve your goals.

## Mentorship Cycle
The mentee will pass in the 3 steps of the mentorship cycle. The first one is to be in a given situation, or having some problem or doubt.
The mentor will analyse and provide some advice and ideas based on his/her experience, thus unblocking the mentee to do more work.
After that, the mentee needs to work, read and reflect on ideas and advice, that will make him/her progress in his/her goals.

## Rules
- be proactive and active, to bring new situations and problems to the mentor
- ask a lot of questions to guide you to find the answer you are looking for
- read everything that was recommended, code everything that is needed, apply advices to test if they work for you
